OrigaME! = Origami + game + ME! 

OrigaME is an application offering origami tutorials for children to follow and create, allowing them to accumulate points that can be exchanged for rewards. The goal is to enable children to delight in learning traditional activities. The initiative challenges the perception that introducing technology to children at a young age is detrimental. Instead, OrigaME aims to counter this stereotype by providing a safe and enjoyable way for children to engage with technology while learning and having fun. 

OrigaME endeavours to serve as a platform where children can be accompanied and nurtured, guiding children to develop a variety of both soft and hard skills as they grow.

Considering that children are at an age where exploring interests and engaging in hobbies is customary, acquiring new skills can profoundly influence them. Introducing a gamified approach to learning the step-by-step instructions of origami could effectively convey the idea that education and acquiring knowledge can be enjoyable and thrilling for them. 

## Design Process

So why Origami?
From our research, we found out that Origami is beneficial for children for various reasons. Firstly, it helps kids develop their hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills as they meticulously fold and handle paper to create intricate drawings. Origami also helps kids develop cognitive skills like spatial reasoning, attention to detail, and problem-solving abilities since they must follow instructions step-by-step and see how a flat sheet can be transformed into a three-dimensional item. Additionally, youths can develop their artistic side and express themselves through paper folding with origami, which encourages creativity and imagination. Because it takes concentration and resolve to finish a challenging origami creation, this art form also instils patience and endurance. In conclusion, origami provides a fun and educational outlet for children to enhance both their physical and cognitive development. Hence, we decided to utilize Origami as our selling point.

We decided to use purple/indigo as one of our main colors, as from research, we found out that those colours are perfect for children due to its captivating nature, purple is linked with wisdom and spirituality. It blends the stability of blue with the energy of red, adopting the qualities of either depending on the shade. This colour is beneficial for children as it not only captures their attention but also fosters a sense of imagination, creativity, and introspection. The balance of stability and energy in purple can contribute to a stimulating and thoughtful environment, promoting cognitive development and a positive emotional experience for young minds. 

Our website is mainly catered towards parents and children. As a parent, they would want a product that is convincing enough to let them trust their children to use the website, and hence we implemented phrases and messages in the website to comfort the parent, letting them know that our product is safe for their children to use.

As a child using OrigaME!, they would want something exciting and amusing to capture their attention, hence, we gamified Origami by adding a point and reward system. Children can complete tutorials in OrigaME!, collect points, and exchange them into a wide variety of rewards.
